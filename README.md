// Using Arduino programming I made Temperature and humidity sensing system . 
sesor DHT11 sense the environment condition and measure the temperature and humidity that  printed on lcd and serial monitor.
In this project i also use buttons and dc motor.
buttons are used to control the speed of the DC motor .
When dc motor roate. It generate air flow that altering the environment conditions sense by DHT11 sensor.
