# Temperature and Humidity sensing system.
#Developed a Arduino programming code for Temperature and Humidity sensing system using Arduino and DHT11 sensor. I connect buttons, dc motor , motor driver ,DHT11 sensor , 16x2 LCD screen .
To display the value I used Serial monitor and LCD .To control the speed of motor ,buttons are used .to drive motor L293D motor drive IC is used .

#The code I developed effectively measures the temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment.
